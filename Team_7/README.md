# OS lab-Deadlock and Concurrency Module

The algorithms are implemented under 3 categories here: 

Deadlock, Concurrency and Semaphore

Deadlock:                                                                                                                    Banker's Algorithm

Concurrency:                                                                                                                        Turn variable,                                                                                                                                  Lock variable,                                                                                                                                 Test and set lock,                                                                                                                       Producer consumer,                                                                                                             Peterson's algorithm 

Semaphore:                                                                                                                                 Binary semaphore,                                                                                                              Counting semaphore
